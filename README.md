# RTS

Not an actual RTS, more a rendering engine for an underlying 2D tile based RTS. Is able to efficiently update and render 20,000 tiles of 3 different tile types.

# Future
This will likely end up being the base rendering engine when I finally have an idea for an RTS.
Obviously the tile rendering can be used for other open games such as sandboxes, however it will be implemented into a future RTS I am currently thinking up.
