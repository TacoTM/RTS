#OBSOLETE
Working on a newer tile generation platform with cleaner code and new methods.

# Introduction

A rendering engine for an underlying 2D tile based RTS. Is able to efficiently update and render 20,000 tiles of 3 different tile types. 

# What's happening now

It is now being evolved into a game. I plan on this game having a set map and the player plays through a series of random disasters. The main objective of the player is to keep their island intact as much as possible.
